Ok, wow, I just... still trying to wrap my head around what the heck I just saw. Ask Sadece Bir An — what was that even? So, I left the theater and my shoes are sticky, I think from all the soda spills. The popcorn stuck in my teeth kinda annoying, but whatever. Man, that scene where she was screaming on the rooftop, all those lights, like a rainbow just exploded? Unreal. Felt like I was in a disco gone bad. But in a good way, if it makes any sense?

> The lady next to me, kept whispering to her husband, kinda wished they were on mute for a better experience, you know? But no, I couldn’t help getting sucked into their bickering mid-sentence. Backache’s killing me, guess these seats aren’t really chiropractor-approved or something.

And then that guy with the pigeons! Totally random. Like, are we supposed to find meaning in a dude feeding birds while the city floods around him? It made me think of that time when my cousin got stuck in an elevator with a parrot. Utter chaos, but also — profound, somehow?

If you’re gonna download the movie, prepare to be tangled in music that makes your soul twist, and whether it will release you is an entirely different matter. Watch the movie with subtitles, cuz those dialogues alone can leave you a bit like... huh? Emotions bouncing like ping pong balls all over the place – dizzying, in a carnival ride kinda way.

Oh, wait, the ending, what even was that? Just cuts to black and leaves you hanging! Somewhere between enlightened and confused, like when I ordered a sandwich and got a salad. The whole thing didn’t just talk to you; it screamed at, whispered to, and then ignored you, all at once.

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // Process of undefined behavior 
    }
    return 0;
}
